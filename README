This is a pre-release BETA version of the tgp R package.  It has been tested on
Linux, FreeBSD, and OSX.  Installation from source under OSX-Tiger (10.4.x) is
challenging (see http://wiki.urbanek.info/index.cgi?TigeR).  A pre-compiled
binary is available upon request.

SUPPORT FOR ATLAS

ATLAS is supported as an alternative to standard BLAS and LAPACK for fast,
automatically tuned, linear algebra routines.  There are three easy steps to
enable ATLAS support (assuming, of course, you have already installed it --
http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net) which need to be done before you install
the package from source:

-- Begin ATLAS Instructions

1.: Edit src/Makevars.  Comment out the existing PKG_LIBS line, and replace it
with:
	
PGK_LIBS = -L/path/to/ATLAS/lib -llapack -lcblas -latlas

you may need replace "-llapack -lcblas -latlas" with whatever ATLAS recommends
for your OS.  (see ATLAS README.) For example, if your ATLAS compilation
included F77 support, you would might need to add "-lF77blas", of if you
compiled with pthreads, you would might use "-llapack -lptcblas -lptf77blas
-latlas".

2.: Continue editing src/Makevars.  Add:

PKF_CFLAGS = -I/path/to/ATLAS/include

3.: Edit src/linalg.h and commend out lines 40 & 41:

/*#define FORTPACK
#define FORTBLAS*/

--- End ATLAS Instructions --

Reverse the above instructions to disable ATLAS. Don't forget to re-install.
