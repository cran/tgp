1.1-7 (23 Aug 2006)
-----

Added the ability to get traces of all parameters,
except the hierarchical ones

Fixed bug to undo.m0r1 so that quantile differences
don't have the mean subtracted out twice

Changes to allow "..." arguments to mapT, and plotting
of 2-d slices of input locations

Minor fix to do params->Print() within model->Print().

Begin addition of mr_tgp, by Matt Taddy.  When these
changes are complete, we should be moving to version
2.0


1.1-6 (26 Jun 2006)
-----

Added Latin Hypercube design function

Added "mapT" function for stand-alone plotting of MAP
partitions via projection and slice.  Fixed bug in
"tgp.plot.slice" in the process

Also now calling "tgp.get.partitions" by the shorter
name "partition"


1.1-5 (27 May 2006)
-----

Fixed memory leak with RNG state in predict_consumer

Solved -DPARALLEL adaptive sampling mystery

exp2d.rand now returns more information about responses
including ZZ, Ztrue, and ZZtrue


1.1-4 (22 May 2006)
-----

Instructions for compiling with Pthreads.

Got rid of duplicate printing of d[a,b] in tgp header.

Added verb arguments to specify how verbose the 
R-console printing should be be.


1.1-3: (16 Apr 2006)
------

Necessary changes in order to get read_ctrlfile to work
for the command-line (non-R) interface to tgp, and other
minor changes.

Noticed bug for bcart and b0tau options due to bad T-
matrix initialization -- fixed.


1.1-2: (04 Mar 2006)
------

1. Beta version of Matern correllation function working
(abiet a bit shakily)

2. Tgp class and cleanup function now implemented in 
order to let tgp be interrupted, and then clean up to
avoid memory leaks "on.exit()"


1.1-1: (26 Feb 2006)
------

Minor edits to documentation.


1.1: (22 Feb 2006)
----

1. Modularization overhall of C/C++ code for passing 
to Matt Taddy, who will be responsible for such future
additions as Matern correllation functions, and multi-
resolution GP implementations.

2. Plotting inhancements, including 1-d projections
and (now default) loess interpolation for 2-d surfaces
and projections, plotting of ALC & EGO statistics,
and ability to control plot layout to show mean surface,
error surface, or both.

3. URL/Email now to UCSC/AMS address.


1.0-2: (Dec 2005)
------

1. Wrote generic random deviate function which can use
unif_rand(), randomkit, and erand48.

2. Fixed up some documentation bugs and typos.

3. system command in model.cc no longer calls "rm" which
doesn't work on Windows.


1.0-1: (Dec 2005)
------

1. No longer using erand48; using unif_rand() from R for
Windows compatibility.
