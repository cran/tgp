1.2-3 (09 Apr 2007)
-----

check.matrix modified to allow one-column matrix Z
arguments which have column-name information

tgp.trees calculation of rows and columns corrected for
situations when there is a height 1 tree


1.2-2 (19 Dec 2006)
-----

slice.interp bugs fixed (is.null(NULL) and plotting of
axis labels) and tick marks added

added R argument to predict.tgp and changed the krige
argument to be called MAP

added new krige argument to b* and predict.tgp to allow
the user to control whether Z*k* kriging samples are to
be obtained (possibly saving on memory)

bug involving the order of trees read from files in the
tgp.get.trees function is fixed; as a result the $trees
output field in "tgp"-class objects is listed by height
and so may contain NULL entries

documented plot.tgp and predict.tgp with the method
markup


1.2-1 (03 Dec 2006)
-----

Added "cart-" option to bprior in order to allow a 
CART style mean rather than a LM mean


1.2 (21 Nov 2006)
---

Now allowing BTE[2]-BTE[1] % BTE[3] != 0

Added predict.tgp and necesary functionality to save 
and load in MAP tgp model for later prediction

Corrected par calculation in tgp.trees for non-default
which argument when there is an unprinted height 1 tree

Traces not recorded for linarea, parts, and ego, when 
they are off or fixed to unchanging settings

Fixed EGO calculations; now calling them "improv", made
them thread-safe, and added improv samples to traces

Also now renamed ds2x to Ds2x, and made Ds2x (i.e., ALC) 
calculations thread-safe

Elipses to b* function allow other params arguments to 
be passed to replace defaults in tgp.default.params()

Added traces of hierarchical parameters, and all 
predictive summaries (including kriging means and vars)

Initial implementation of Importance Tempering idea

Calculating variances of predictive distribution, and
saving kriging means and variances

Fixed numPrunable (P+1) calculation in grow attempts

EGO calculations made thread-safe


1.1-11 (20 Sept 2006)
------

Bad compilation flags caused bad bug in log_HierPrior
to go unnoticed until assertion failure on Windows


1.1-10 (19 Sept 2006)
------

Fixed big compute_ego() bug

Tweaks to RNG seeds so that they give same sequence
across platforms (tested on OSX/PB & Linux/Xeons)

Allow X=NULL in dopt.gp()

Removal of constansts LOG_2_PI covered by R internal
M_LOG_SQRT_2PI

Added mvnpdf_log_dup and wishpdf_log functions

Corrected full log-pdf function for tree prior, and
added log-pdf of W and B0


1.1-9 (03 Sept 2006)
-----

Many comments added in predict[_linear].c and exp_sep.cc

Fixed ds2x (predict_linear) memory leak

Fixed Matern bug -- now using correct pwr=1 distance
computation; added comments to gen_covar.c

Compilation warnings addressed in update of compat-
ibility with C/C++ adaptive sampling (as) code

Now getting BestPartitions from Tgp instead of at the
end of Model::Rounds


1.1-8 (29 Aug 2006)
-----

Added trace capability for Matern corr family

Fixed bug that num_consumed is not updated on final
NULL read from tlist

Using new log_bessel_k() function to bypass allocs of 
floor(nu)+1 double each time bessel_k() was called


1.1-7 (23 Aug 2006)
-----

Added the ability to get traces of all parameters,
except the hierarchical ones

Fixed bug to undo.m0r1 so that quantile differences
don't have the mean subtracted out twice

Changes to allow "..." arguments to mapT, and plotting
of 2-d slices of input locations

Minor fix to do params->Print() within model->Print().

Begin addition of mr_tgp, by Matt Taddy.  When these
changes are complete, we should be moving to version
2.0


1.1-6 (26 Jun 2006)
-----

Added Latin Hypercube design function

Added "mapT" function for stand-alone plotting of MAP
partitions via projection and slice.  Fixed bug in
"tgp.plot.slice" in the process

Also now calling "tgp.get.partitions" by the shorter
name "partition"


1.1-5 (27 May 2006)
-----

Fixed memory leak with RNG state in predict_consumer

Solved -DPARALLEL adaptive sampling mystery

exp2d.rand now returns more information about responses
including ZZ, Ztrue, and ZZtrue


1.1-4 (22 May 2006)
-----

Instructions for compiling with Pthreads.

Got rid of duplicate printing of d[a,b] in tgp header.

Added verb arguments to specify how verbose the 
R-console printing should be be.


1.1-3: (16 Apr 2006)
------

Necessary changes in order to get read_ctrlfile to work
for the command-line (non-R) interface to tgp, and other
minor changes.

Noticed bug for bcart and b0tau options due to bad T-
matrix initialization -- fixed.


1.1-2: (04 Mar 2006)
------

1. Beta version of Matern correllation function working
(abiet a bit shakily)

2. Tgp class and cleanup function now implemented in 
order to let tgp be interrupted, and then clean up to
avoid memory leaks "on.exit()"


1.1-1: (26 Feb 2006)
------

Minor edits to documentation.


1.1: (22 Feb 2006)
----

1. Modularization overhall of C/C++ code for passing 
to Matt Taddy, who will be responsible for such future
additions as Matern correllation functions, and multi-
resolution GP implementations.

2. Plotting inhancements, including 1-d projections
and (now default) loess interpolation for 2-d surfaces
and projections, plotting of ALC & EGO statistics,
and ability to control plot layout to show mean surface,
error surface, or both.

3. URL/Email now to UCSC/AMS address.


1.0-2: (Dec 2005)
------

1. Wrote generic random deviate function which can use
unif_rand(), randomkit, and erand48.

2. Fixed up some documentation bugs and typos.

3. system command in model.cc no longer calls "rm" which
doesn't work on Windows.


1.0-1: (Dec 2005)
------

1. No longer using erand48; using unif_rand() from R for
Windows compatibility.
