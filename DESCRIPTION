Description: Bayesian nonstationary, semiparametric nonlinear regression and design
 by treed Gaussian processes with jumps to the limiting linear model (LLM).  Special 
 cases also implemented include Bayesian linear models, CART, treed linear models, 
 stationary separable and isotropic Gaussian processes.  Provides
 1-d and 2-d plotting functions (with projection and slice capabilities) 
 and tree drawing, designed for visualization of tgp-class output.
