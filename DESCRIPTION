Description: Bayesian Nonparametric and nonstationary regression by treed 
 Gaussian processes with jumps to the limiting linear model (LLM).  Special 
 cases also implememted include Bayesian linear models, linear CART, 
 stationary separable and isotropic Gaussian process regression.  Includes
 1d and 2d plotting functions (with higher dimension projection and slice
 capabilities), and tree drawing, designed for visualization of tgp class 
 output. (2d plotting requires akima; tree plotting requires maptree and
 combinat.)
