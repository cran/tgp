Description: Bayesian semiparametric and nonstationary regression by treed 
 Gaussian processes with jumps to the limiting linear model (LLM).  Special 
 cases also implememted include Bayesian linear models, linear CART, 
 stationary separable and isotropic Gaussian process regression.  Provides
 1-d and 2-d plotting functions (with projection and slice capabilities) 
 and tree drawing, designed for visualization of tgp-class output.
