2.1-1 (7 April 2008)
-----

separaing tcounts and cum_tcounts and resetting tcounts to
the average of cum_tcounts at beginning of each round

fixed bug in returning of tcounts back to R by encuring that
its->UpdateProbs() is always called after the last of R 
rounds whenever its->Numit() > 1

return ess information at each inverse temperature back to
R for storage in the tgp-class object


2.1 (22 March 2008)
---

moved CHANGES to ChangeLog for the new CRAN packages
page

cleaned up tgp vignette into one .Rnw file including
several .iRnw files

added linear=FALSE to akima interp commands

stopped printing both separate ess and essN in IT method

added new itemps.barplot function for visualizing the number
of visits to each inverse temperature in the ST-MCMC chain

now tcounts (observation counts) for IT are accumulated
across repeats (R>=2) -- not sure if this is a good idea

now recording tree acceptance rates (Grow, Prune Change
and Swap accepts over total)

propogated splitmin to up to the R interface, and added
a basemax paramter also specifiable in the R inferface --
the parameters allow control of which X colums can
be partitioned upon (by the tree) and which appear in the
base (GP) model

added heights="map" argument to tgp.trees for plotting only
the tree corresponding to the maximum a' posteriori tree

wrote two sections in the new vignette (tgp2): one on
splitmin and basemax (i.e., categorical inputs) and one
on importance tempering

 
2.0-4 (23 Jan 2008)
-----

made a change suggested by Andrea Spano to make the
partition function more robust when new X values 
(on a different range from the original data) are 
provided


2.0-3 (27 Dec 2007)
-----

commented the moving average code (for sens) and made
it more efficient


2.0-2 (12 Dec 2007)
-----

allow mode in the sens function to be be within the 
bounds of rect -- i.e., stop checking for positive mode

fixed dyslexic error in man page for sens describing
total effect indices

fixed missing braces in some .Rd files

shortened to LGPL in DESCRIPTION


2.0-1 (1 Oct 2007)
-----

Memory savings: preds->ZZ and preds->Zp only allocated when 
pred.n=TRUE, preds->w and preds->itemp only allocated when
ST or IT or IS

corrected default.itemps() example barplot and changed 
k.min to 0.1 to agree with IT paper

fixed zcov bug in tgp.postprocess


2.0 (21 Sept 2007) 
---

consolidated R functions from individual files into those
grouped by task

made gridlen argument a 2-vector so the grid size can be
specified in both x and y

new economy argument to tree and Base duplicators so that 
the entire set of covariance matrices is not copied unless
necessary

Matt Taddy officially joins the list of authors, adding
multi-resolution tgp and sensitivity analysis

importance tempering, with importance sampling and 
simulated tempering support

Latin hypercube sampling with respect to a Beta 
distribution

moved most of the reading of parameters out of the Tgp
constructor and into Tgp::Init so that tgp_cleanup() can 
safely delete the Tgp module even it it wasn't successfully 
initialized

ordered multiple improv statistics

predictive covariances now calculated instead of variances


1.2-7 (19 Aug 2007)
-----

tgp.partition 1-d data handling made more robust

removed assertion on w that tends to fail for unknown
reasons


1.2-6 (17 June 2007)
-----

added number of leaves to traces

fixed CART bug in Gp::predict that was already handled in 
v1.3, thanks to Taddy, but was bad in the CRAN version


1.2-5 (29 May 2007)
-----

allowing btgp to do a linburn

$parts is a now a matrix, and $linburn now {TRUE,FALSE}

$tree and $hier removed from tgp-class output, and
$trace correctly removed when input trace=FALSE

got rid of some hanging code fragments in documentation
of btgp and dopt.gp


1.2-4 (07 May 2007)
-----

fixed a leak when krige=FALSE appearing in Tree::Predict

fixed sub-vignette cutting for preds and traces

corrected documentation of nug.p in tgp.default.params()

added verbosity and iter arguments to dopt and thus
dopt.gp and tgp.design


1.2-3 (09 Apr 2007)
-----

updates to the vignette for the JSS publication

check.matrix modified to allow one-column matrix Z
arguments which have column-name information

tgp.trees calculation of rows and columns corrected for
situations when there is a height 1 tree


1.2-2 (19 Dec 2006)
-----

slice.interp bugs fixed (is.null(NULL) and plotting of
axis labels) and tick marks added

added R argument to predict.tgp and changed the krige
argument to be called MAP

added new krige argument to b* and predict.tgp to allow
the user to control whether Z*k* kriging samples are to
be obtained (possibly saving on memory)

bug involving the order of trees read from files in the
tgp.get.trees function is fixed; as a result the $trees
output field in "tgp"-class objects is listed by height
and so may contain NULL entries

documented plot.tgp and predict.tgp with the method
markup


1.2-1 (03 Dec 2006)
-----

Added "cart-" option to bprior in order to allow a 
CART style mean rather than a LM mean


1.2 (21 Nov 2006)
---

Now allowing BTE[2]-BTE[1] % BTE[3] != 0

Added predict.tgp and necessary functionality to save 
and load in MAP tgp model for later prediction

Corrected par calculation in tgp.trees for non-default
which argument when there is an unprinted height 1 tree

Traces not recorded for linarea, parts, and ego, when 
they are off or fixed to unchanging settings

Fixed EGO calculations; now calling them "improv", made
them thread-safe, and added improv samples to traces

Also now renamed ds2x to Ds2x, and made Ds2x (i.e., ALC) 
calculations thread-safe

Ellipses to b* function allow other params arguments to 
be passed to replace defaults in tgp.default.params()

Added traces of hierarchical parameters, and all 
predictive summaries (including kriging means and vars)

Initial implementation of Importance Tempering idea

Calculating variances of predictive distribution, and
saving kriging means and variances

Fixed numPrunable (P+1) calculation in grow attempts

EGO calculations made thread-safe

Bad compilation flags caused bad bug in log_HierPrior
to go unnoticed until assertion failure on Windows

Removal of constants LOG_2_PI covered by R internal
M_LOG_SQRT_2PI

Added mvnpdf_log_dup and wishpdf_log functions

Corrected full log-pdf function for tree prior, and
added log-pdf of W and B0

1.1-7 (23 Aug 2006)
-----

Added the ability to get traces of all parameters,
except the hierarchical ones

Fixed bug to undo.m0r1 so that quantile differences
don't have the mean subtracted out twice

Changes to allow "..." arguments to mapT, and plotting
of 2-d slices of input locations

Minor fix to do params->Print() within model->Print().

Begin addition of mr_tgp, by Matt Taddy.  When these
changes are complete, we should be moving to version
2.0


1.1-6 (26 Jun 2006)
-----

Added Latin Hypercube design function

Added "mapT" function for stand-alone plotting of MAP
partitions via projection and slice.  Fixed bug in
"tgp.plot.slice" in the process

------

Minor edits to documentation.


1.1: (22 Feb 2006)
----

1. Modularization overhall of C/C++ code for passing 
to Matt Taddy, who will be responsible for such future
additions as Matern correlation functions, and multi-
resolution GP implementations.

2. Plotting enhancements, including 1-d projections
and (now default) loess interpolation for 2-d surfaces
and projections, plotting of ALC & EGO statistics,
and ability to control plot layout to show mean surface,
error surface, or both.

3. URL/Email now to UCSC/AMS address.
