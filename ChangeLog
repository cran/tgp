using shape to drive categorical calculations rather than
bmax

minor edit to tgp2 doc to correct fried.bool description, and
edit to fried.bool to fix fried.bool(1) problem


2.4 (20 Sept 2010)

-----

added a check for a full rank design matrix in the
pre-processing of inputs

corrected some syntax errors in .Rd files caught by 
new checks on CRAN

changed sens warning to check for nn > 0 instead of null
XX which was causing a warning to be printed every time
regardless of whether or not there was a violation


2.2-3 (22 Jul 2009)
-----

added nug.p=0 option to cause the nugget to stay fixed
at the params$gd[1] value.  bcart, btlm, and blm now
automatically use nug.p=0 since the nugget is not
identified in these models 


2.2-2 (27 May 2009)
-----

caught a signifigant typo/bug in Xsplit pre-processing
in R which was causing the bounding rectangle to be
computed improperly

removed combinat dependency


2.2-1 (20 Feb 2009)

added Tree::Clear() to rejected prunes in Tree::Prune()

tgp.default.params and tgp.check.params now allow the min
partition size to depend on basemax rather than d

the bounding rectangle and the valid tree-split locations
are now governed by an Xsplit automatically generated in
the tgp R function, and gathered from the tgp object in
predict.tgp
	

2.2 (16 Jan 2009)
---

added lower bound for s2_g0, and added DEFAULT CPP macros
to help prevent assertions which would have backed out of
bad parameterizations anyways.  This more liberal approach
essentially prevents assertions in the no-noise regression
case

now allow basemax != d for constant mean functions

added categorical LHS for sensitivity analyses

finished draft of second vignette, to be submitted to JSS
	

2.1-6 (25 Nov 2008)

-----

added check for >= d+1 unique rows of X in Tree::Singular

changed how d an nug are printed in the progress meter for
mrtgp

added par(mfrow=c(1,1)) to default 1-d mrtgp plots


2.1-4 (17 Oct 2008)
-----

are ranked by the expected improvement statistic by 
allowing the improv argument to b* functions to take a
2-vector input.  Also no longer ranks points with an 
improvement statistic of zero


2.1-3 (7 Oct 2008)
-----

added check for >1 unique Z in Tree::Singular

allow (undocumented) specification of minpart through the
ellipses (...) argument to the b* functions

documentation has been updated (but the pdfs have not been
regenerated in the current version)


2.1-2 (17 April 2008)
-----

introduced params$Wi and made it so that params${b,Wi} set
both the starting an prior values for the corresponding
parameters.

added bprior="bmznot" so that tau2 can be fixed at its
starting value


2.1-1 (4 April 2008)
-----

separaing tcounts and cum_tcounts and resetting tcounts to
the average of cum_tcounts at beginning of each round

fixed bug in returning of tcounts back to R by encuring that
its->UpdateProbs() is always called after the last of R 
rounds whenever its->Numit() > 1

return ess information at each inverse temperature back to
R for storage in the tgp-class object


2.1 (22 March 2008)
---

moved CHANGES to ChangeLog for the new CRAN packages
page

cleaned up tgp vignette into one .Rnw file including
several .iRnw files

added linear=FALSE to akima interp commands

stopped printing both separate ess and essN in IT method

added new itemps.barplot function for visualizing the number
of visits to each inverse temperature in the ST-MCMC chain

now tcounts (observation counts) for IT are accumulated
across repeats (R>=2) -- not sure if this is a good idea

now recording tree acceptance rates (Grow, Prune Change
and Swap accepts over total)

propogated splitmin to up to the R interface, and added
a basemax paramter also specifiable in the R inferface --
the parameters allow control of which X colums can
be partitioned upon (by the tree) and which appear in the
base (GP) model

added heights="map" argument to tgp.trees for plotting only
the tree corresponding to the maximum a' posteriori tree

wrote two sections in the new vignette (tgp2): one on
splitmin and basemax (i.e., categorical inputs) and one
on importance tempering

 
2.0-4 (23 Jan 2008)
-----

made a change suggested by Andrea Spano to make the
partition function more robust when new X values 
(on a different range from the original data) are 
provided


2.0-3 (27 Dec 2007)
-----

commented the moving average code (for sens) and made
it more efficient

---

consolidated R functions from individual files into those
grouped by task

made gridlen argument a 2-vector so the grid size can be

multi-resolution tgp and sensitivity analysis

importance tempering, with importance sampling and 
simulated tempering support

Latin hypercube sampling with respect to a Beta 
distribution

moved most of the reading of parameters out of the Tgp

1.2-7 (19 Aug 2007)
-----

the user to control whether Z*k* kriging samples are to
be obtained (possibly saving on memory)

bug involving the order of trees read from files in the
tgp.get.trees function is fixed; as a result the $trees
output field in "tgp"-class objects is listed by height
and so may contain NULL entries

documented plot.tgp and predict.tgp with the method
markup


1.2-1 (03 Dec 2006)
-----

Added "cart-" option to bprior in order to allow a 
CART style mean rather than a LM mean

be passed to replace defaults in tgp.default.params()

Added traces of hierarchical parameters, and all 
predictive summaries (including kriging means and vars)

Initial implementation of Importance Tempering idea

Calculating variances of predictive distribution, and
saving kriging means and variances

Fixed numPrunable (P+1) calculation in grow attempts

EGO calculations made thread-safe


1.1-11 (20 Sept 2006)

don't have the mean subtracted out twice

Changes to allow "..." arguments to mapT, and plotting
of 2-d slices of input locations

Minor fix to do params->Print() within model->Print().

Begin addition of mr_tgp, by Matt Taddy.  When these
changes are complete, we should be moving to version
2.0


1.1-6 (26 Jun 2006)
-----

Added Latin Hypercube design function

Added "mapT" function for stand-alone plotting of MAP
partitions via projection and slice.  Fixed bug in

to Matt Taddy, who will be responsible for such future
additions as Matern correlation functions, and multi-
resolution GP implementations.
